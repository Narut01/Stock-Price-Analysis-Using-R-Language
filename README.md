# Stock Market Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing stock market data to gain insights into the performance of various stocks. The analysis includes computing key statistical metrics, visualizing stock data through different types of plots, and exploring relationships between stock prices. The goal is to understand stock trends, distributions, and correlations to support investment decisions.

## Problem Statement
Investors and financial analysts need comprehensive insights into stock performance to make informed decisions. This project aims to analyze stock price data, compute important statistical measures, visualize the data in various formats, and explore correlations between different stocks. The findings will help in understanding the dynamics of stock prices and guide investment strategies.

## Data
The dataset used in this project is a CSV file containing historical stock price data for multiple companies. The data includes columns for different stock indices such as NIFTY 50, RELIA, INFY, TCS, and ITC.

## Key Findings
- **Statistical Analysis:** Computed mean, standard deviation, and median for each stock index. Analyzed skewness and kurtosis to understand the distribution of stock prices.
- **Visualizations:** Created histograms, line graphs, bar charts, and pie charts to visualize stock price distributions, trends, and proportions.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Examined the correlation between INFY and TCS stock prices using scatter plots with regression lines.
- **Linear Regression:** Developed a linear regression model to describe the relationship between INFY and TCS stock prices.
- **Density Plots:** Plotted density graphs to visualize the distribution of stock prices for various indices.

## Visualizations
Here are some of the key visualizations produced:

- **Histograms:** Show the distribution of stock prices for NIFTY 50, RELIA, INFY, TCS, and ITC.
- **Line Graphs:** Illustrate stock price trends over time for NIFTY 50, RELIA, INFY, TCS, and ITC.
- **Bar Charts:** Display the maximum stock prices for different years.
- **Pie Charts:** Represent the proportion of different stock indices.
- **Scatter Plots:** Show the correlation between INFY and TCS stock prices.
- **Density Plots:** Provide insights into the distribution of stock prices for various indices.
